Osprey Delight is the free-minded artist's choice for a clutter-free and blazingly fast single-page portfolio. It's perfectly suited to show off your awesome work! 

This theme is built around the modules shown on the demo site [Hugo Mods](https://hugo-mods.github.io/), making it highly customizable. 
If you are only interested in a subset of the functionality, take a look at the existing modules [in the `hugo-mods` GitHub organization](https://github.com/hugo-mods).

> Originating from [the great Osprey theme](https://github.com/tomanistor/osprey), it brings new features to your **delight** while keeping the original design idea.
