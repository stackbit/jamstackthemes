# Minimal, responsive, and no frills theme

Dark Poole is a permanent dark theme of the Poole theme by [@mdo](https://github.com/mdo). I made the theme darker, inspired by [Derek Kedziora's site](https://derekkedziora.com/). Unlike default Poole that utilizes CSS media queries to activate dark mode, the theme will stay dark regardless of the user's preference.

## Features

- Easy customization, the theme is forked from the well known Poole theme.
- Blog pagination
