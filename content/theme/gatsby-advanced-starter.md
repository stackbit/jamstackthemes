# A starter skeleton with advanced features

The Advanced Starter doesn't define any UI limitations in any way and only gives you the basic components for SEO/Links/Infinite Scrolling while creating a comfortable development environment to get started.

Starter supports both [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and JavaScript, comes with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) configurations and allows you to write Unit/Integration/E2E tests out of the box.

You are free to use any UI framework/styling options or you can use the [`gatsby-theme-amaranth`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-theme-amaranth) as a starting point, which provides a stylish blog design styled with [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
