# jekyll-nagymaros

Nagymaros is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme designed for conferences, workshops, meetings, and similar events. It has a simple and intuitive structure featuring four pages that provide key information about the event:

- An index, meant for basic details and links to external sources, such as submission systems.
- A program, allowing for single or multi-day schedules and color-coded event categories.
- A map of conference locations, customizable with markers, areas, and tooltips.
- An alphabetical list of contributors, with optional roles and email addresses.

The theme is based on [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/), which makes it mobile-first and fully responsive. Body text is set in Inter, a clean sans-serif typeface that guarantees readability at small screen sizes. A slab-serif typeface, Zilla Slab, is used instead in display headings. The layout is adapted from [jekyll-conference-theme](https://github.com/DigitaleGesellschaft/jekyll-theme-conference) and remains quite similar to it, but compared to this theme, Nagymaros aims to be simpler and easier to customize.

See the [demo](https://jekyll-nagymaros.netlify.app) to find out what the theme looks like.
