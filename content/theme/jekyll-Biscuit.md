# Biscuit theme for Jekyll

[Biscuit](http://sblisesivdin.github.io/biscuit) is a single-page responsive Jekyll theme. This is the most simple and still-good-looking Jekyll theme that you can find.

## Usage

You can use this theme with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) or you can simply use it with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
For local usage just download [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), use installation guide for more. You can download latest Biscuit from [its Github repository](https://github.com/sblisesivdin/biscuit).

If you prefer to use Github Pages, you do not need to download it, upload files to a new repository...etc, just [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-starter/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and use it.
