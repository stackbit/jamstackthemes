Pole is *a one-column minimal responsive Jekyll blog theme*.

One of the purposes of Pole is to be an alternative option to the default theme of Jekyll -- [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). Pole is still keeping minimal, but meanwhile, more beautiful and mellow, and doesn't lose some useful basic features, such as archive.
