# A simple starter kit for researchers, built with SvelteKit

Paws is a static site built on SvelteKit, using Markdown for blog content, optionally with Netlify CMS. Developer tooling to help with editing the template in VSCode is provided.

"Static site" means that the website is made up of pre-built HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript. The web pages load the same way every time, unlike dynamic websites, which load differently based on things such as the user's location, the time of day, or user actions. A static website can be served for free or very low cost, and provides a smooth and fast experience for users of the website. There's no content database to make things slow, or pose security issues as in for example a Wordpress site.
