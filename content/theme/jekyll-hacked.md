# hacked-jekyll

Hacked Jekyll is a responsive, minimalistic Jekyll theme for a tiny (163kb!) personal website. It consists of a homepage and a 404 page. The homepage lists information set within the configuration file in a format that resembles JSON, giving the website a "hacked" appearance. The user description features [typed.js](https://mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/) to cycle through multiple lines of text, as long as multiple lines are provided in the configuration.

The style is rebooted through [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and based on the [Open Color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) library. The monospaced typeface [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) is served together with the website. The favicons are generated by [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/).

See the [demo](https://hacked-jekyll.netlify.app) to check the end result.
