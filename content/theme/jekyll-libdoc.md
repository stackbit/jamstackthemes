# A documentation theme with its playground

LibDoc is a Jekyll theme that was crafted to easily and quickly get properly designed documentation especially for CSS and Javascript libraries. It comes with a [built-in playground](https://olivier3lanc.github.io/Jekyll-LibDoc/libdoc-playground.html) and local search engine.

A major feature of the LibDoc Jekyll theme is its own built-in and configurable playground which is both a [layout](https://olivier3lanc.github.io/Jekyll-LibDoc/libdoc-layouts.html#playground) and a syntax highlighter extension. It extends the [syntax highlighter](https://olivier3lanc.github.io/Jekyll-LibDoc/libdoc-config.html#prismjs-syntax-highlighter) by running the specified code into a configurable context with user defined style sheets and scripts.
