A fully customizable blog template designed for developers (or anyone else) wanting to get into blogging. 
Easy to edit, customize and extended. The blog is completely statically generated via GatsbyJS, comes with syntax highlighting (via PrismJS) out of the box, and has server-side rendering built-in, among other things.
