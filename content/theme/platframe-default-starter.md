Platframe's default (responsive) starter template takes the form of a landing page that can be personalized in a jiffy, or be extensively adapted to suit variable project scopes.  

Multipage sites are well-supported with a growth-proof, scalable architecture. The template allows for granular control, and is powered by an extensible, feature-rich build-system.
