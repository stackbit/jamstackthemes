Example Gatsby, BigCommerce and Netlify CMS project meant to jump start Jamstack ecommerce sites.

Through the use of Netlify Functions, supports a built-in cart and checkout flow (with 50+ payment gateways / methods, advanced tax and shipping providers, etc) that uses the BigCommerce APIs to provide a complete end-to-end shopper experience, without the need for a complex backend or
middleware.

_Note: Requires a BigCommerce store, which you can get a free trial of via bigcommerce.com, which includes API access, if you don't already have an account. There is also an optional partner program which includes a sandbox account to play around in._
