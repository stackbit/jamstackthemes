Lone Wolf Theme is a simple bootstrap based jekyll theme.
It is infamous for abstracting away the frontend code using [Bootstrap 4][bs4]
and [Bootswatch wrappers][bootswatch] to help us focus on the **content** and
the **functions**.

## Features

- Has 4 unique layouts `home`, `page`, `post` and `archive` posts.
- Bootstrap based theme enhanced further with the Bootswatch wrappers.
- Uses animate.css for animations.
- Uses font awesome 5 for icons.
- Optimized for search engines using [Jekyll Seo Tag][jst] gem.
