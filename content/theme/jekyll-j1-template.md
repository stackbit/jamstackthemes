# A fully configurable Jekyll Theme

Jekyll meets Bootstrap - and makes a lot of friends. J1 Template combines
the best of OpenSource software for the Web and the Web site generator
`Jekyll`. J1 is OpenSource, and so are the packaged modules - no pain for
private or professional use. Explore this site to learn what's possible if you go to the Jekyll Way.
