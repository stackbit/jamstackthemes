## Getting started & development 

### Fork and clone this repository
The **vision of this theme** is **simplicity and accessibility**, to easily create stunning websites from scratch.  
Therefore, it's not available as a classic gem-based Jekyll theme, but as a ready-to-use GitHub repository that you just need to fork and clone.  
So, get ahead and make a fork of this repository, rename it if you like to suit the name of the site you want to create, locally clone it, and directly start editing!

### How to start a development docker container
To test your website and see all of your changes in real-time without deploying it online, you can easily build your site locally.  
- Make sure you have [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.  
- Open up a terminal, navigate to your local repository, and run ```docker compose up```.

Your site will then be visible at ```http://0.0.0.0:4000/``` in any browser.
