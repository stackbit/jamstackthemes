Jek is a minimalist Jekyll theme putting the power of color schemes in the user's hands. Toggle between schemes hassle-free, create new ones on the go, and store settings in-browser.

Check out the [Demo site](https://jekyll-jek.netlify.app/), deployed and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

_Warning - this theme requires Jekyll 4 and so will **not** work on GitHub Pages (with Jekyll 3), unless you add a custom CI flow using GitHub Actions._


## ‚ö° Features

+ [x] toggle light/dark
+ [x] choose random theme 
+ [x] save current theme for next visit
+ [x] open/close settings
+ [x] clear settings 

## üí° All About The Theme 

Theme settings are saved in [session](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage) and [local](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) storage. Toggling light/dark mode or choosing a random palette saves settings for only the current session. Clicking the save button adds the theme to local storage for future visits.   

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation  

It's recommended to install Jek by cloning the [repository](https://github.com/tcbutler320/jek). Installation with Gem's will be supported in a future release.

## üë©‚ÄçüöÄ Add New Themes  

Adding new themes to your new jek site could not be easier. Just pick a background color and text color and add them to your `main.css`. Once you're done, add your theme to `_data/themes.yaml`. Check out [colorhunt](https://colorhunt.co/) for inspiration.

1. Add a new scheme to your `main.css` with `background-color` and `color` set.  
    ```css
    .mytheme {
      background-color: #0a1d37;
      color: #ffeedb;
    }
    ```  
2. Add a color scheme name to your `_data/themes.yaml`.  
    ```yaml
    - name: mytheme
      enabled: true
    ```
