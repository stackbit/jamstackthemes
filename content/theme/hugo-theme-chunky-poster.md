Check out the configuration at [`exampleSite/config.toml`](exampleSite/config.toml) for configuring your Hugo site.

## Authors

The authors structure is based on this [blog post](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/07/24/hugo-tips-how-to-create-author-pages/).

1. Add the taxonomy ["author"](exampleSite/config.toml#L28).
2. `hugo new authors/john-doe/_index.md`
3. Configure the author metadata `twitter`.
4. Configure the author metadata `images`. First image on the list will be used as the avatar and on the profile page. Images are page resources under the author e.g. `content/authors/john-doe/image.png`.
5. Assign the author to a content:

    ```yaml
    ---
    authors: ["John Doe"]
    ---
    ```

## Content images

The images structure is based on this [blog post](https://forestry.io/blog/how-to-use-hugo-s-image-processing-with-forestry/).

Upload the images that will be used on content pages under `content/images` and create the file `content/images/index.md` with the front matter:

```yaml
---
headless: true
---
```

Set the path to the image in a `post` content under the `images` property:

```yaml
---
images: ["/images/image.png"]
---
```

The first image on the list will be used as the "cover" image on a post.

## Prism

Configure [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) under `[params.prismJS]`. Set `enable` to `true` and **disable `codeFences`**. Change the theme under `theme`.

```toml
[params]
  [params.prismJS]
    enable = true
    theme = "okaidia"

[markup]
  [markup.highlight]
    codeFences = false
```

## Commento

Configure [Commento](https://commento.io/) under `[params.commento]`. Set `enable` to `true` and add the URL at `url`:

```toml
[params]
  [params.commento]
    enable = true
    theme = "https://somename.commento.io"
```

## Share

Enable sharing under `params` with `share` set to `true` and disable per-post sharing by setting `share` to `false` in the front matter.

```toml
[params]
  share = true
```

```yaml
---
share: false
---
```
