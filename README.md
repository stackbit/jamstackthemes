Github stars and last commit date are generated at build time.
Images will be generated at build time. A screenshort of the `demo` URL will be taken and resized automatically.

## Contribution Guidelines

Any open source themes with a public github repo can be submitted.

If you are adding a SSG or CMS which doesnt exist already you will need to add it as part of your pull-request. New taxonomy terms can be added by creating a markdown file under `content/ssg/` or `content/cms`. Take a look at the existing files to see what front-matter is required. You will also need to upload an icon into `static/images/icons`, preferably the icon is in SVG format under 3KB. If it's a PNG please make sure the size is 60x60px and the size is as small as possible (you should be able to keep it under 5KB)
